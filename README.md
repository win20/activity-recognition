# Activity recognition and heart rate measurement

### Project which consists of two main parts: <br>
1 - calculate a person's heart rate (BPM) by looking at the light passing through their fingertip and measuring the peaks and troughs in light intensity.<br> 
2 - train a machine learning model to recognise what activity given a set of accelerometer, gyroscope and heart rate data.
